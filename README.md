# Vampire Killer
## Presentation
This project is a tribute to the game **_Vampire Killer_**, released by Konami in 1986.

## Description
Vampire Killer, known in Japan as Akumajō Dracula, is a platform video game developed and published by Konami for the MSX2 in 1986. It was released as a parallel version of the original Castlevania, which debuted a month earlier for the Famicom Disk System under the same Japanese title.
Like in Castlevania, the player controls vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who ventures into Dracula's castle armed with a mystical whip inherited from his father, in order to slay the evil count.
